Focussed on student-centred learning, our Teaching & Learning Framework harnesses ICT to enhance learning and equip our students with 21st century life skills and competencies. We offer a conducive and caring environment, and have committed and nurturing teachers who believe in setting high expectations, providing authentic and experiential learning experiences, and inspiring our students to excel in their academic performance, character and leadership development, and CCAs. Over the years, our students have done well in both the academic and non-academic domains.

These objectives are also strengthened by our Global Classroom Programme which broadens our students' minds through the 4 domains: Bicultural Learning, Talent Development, Service Learning and Immersion & Exchange. NCzens are thus groomed to be world-ready, and to possess the meritorious Cultural Intelligence."
