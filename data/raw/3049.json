		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "One signature programme in The Loyang Experience is our Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Effective Communication. The hallmark of a confident person is his/her ability to communicate effectively. LYSS has adopted a whole-school approach to the development of students' oral communication skills through promoting the use of good spoken English in daily interaction within and beyond curriculum time. In addition, we believe in creating opportunities for all students to express themselves in the classroom by using pedagogical approaches that promote oral communication as well as providing platforms beyond the classroom for students who show talent in this area. Some of these platforms include Public Speaking, Debates and Drama. With the emphasis on developing 21st Century Competencies in our students and to create an internationalisation experience for our students, all Sec 3 students will have the opportunity to participate in Overseas Education Programme. The school's Uniformed Groups and Performance Arts groups excel in the area of student development. Through a wide array of activities, students of different backgrounds have ample opportunities to interact with each other and build closer bonds. These programmes also contribute significantly to developing individuals of sound character imbued with the school values of Integrity, Resilience, Respect, and Compassion. Other Programmes Offered Include: Elective and Advanced Elective Modules, Conversational Chinese and Malay, Educational and Career Guidance Programme, National Youth Achievement Award Programme, Overseas Education Programme, Public Speaking Programme, Reading Programme, Sports Education Programme, Student Leadership Programme and Swimming Programme. Enrichment Activities Include: Guitar, Guzheng, Ukulele, Tchoukball and Finger Painting."
