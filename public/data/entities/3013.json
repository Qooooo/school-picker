We are committed to nurturing leaders in the academic, character and arts domains. In doing so, we believe in students learning the value of stewardship,where the best and the brightest TKGians must lead through 'noble service' and to 'serve with honour', as inspired by the school song penned by the first principal Ms Maude Scott in 1953. Our aspiration for being a school of distinction must start from within, with the girls who come through our doors understand how special it is to be TKGian, to understand the obligations and responsibilities in upholding that tradition of excellence which we have built over more than 65 years.",

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The TKGS Curriculum develops 3 distinct characteristics: (a) LEADERS OF CHARACTER who lead from within in service of others; (b) ACCOMPLISHED LEARNERS who demonstrate intellectual character; and (c) WOMEN OF GRACE who are creative thinkers in their appreciation and advancement of the arts. LEADERS OF CHARACTER: Grounded on the TKGS leadership philosophy where leadership is not about rank, position or title but towards the service of others, our signature 4-year ViA programme guides all students to take the lead in exploring and deciding the causes they want to champion. Students are supported in such endeavours through practices picked up in lessons facilitated by teachers and working with external partners who all believe in the mission of nurturing TKGians to be leaders. In also believing that every student can lead in her own way, various leadership opportunities within our vibrant student body grow each TKGian to flourish in her own ways. ACCOMPLISHED LEARNERS: The TKGS Academic Curriculum integrates tasks which deepen disciplinary thinking and encourage explorations beyond the syllabus. We take special pride in our rich culture of EL learning, where the school serves as the East Zone Centre of Excellence. Besides being guided to take up a high level of personal responsibility towards their own learning by planning consultations and collaborations outside of class, TKGians can look forward to stretching themselves through the TKGS+ programme, to lead their peers in academic learning and exercise stewardship of their gifts. WOMEN OF GRACE: With a rich tradition in the Performing Arts, we are known for students who enjoy initiating their own performances and engaging with different audiences and fellow performers. Other than the opportunity to pursue Art, Music & Drama at the O levels, our 5 distinguished Performing Arts CCA groups provides for a vibrant Performing Arts scene - not just within the school but also beyond."
