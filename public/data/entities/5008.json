			"De La Salle School was founded in 1952 by the De La Salle Brothers, and is one of the eight Christian Brothers Schools (CBS) in Singapore. The School takes pride in providing an all-inclusive environment for students (Lasallians) and staff of all races and religions to learn and work together.  The School believes that all Lasallians have the faith and zeal to learn and live to the best of their ability.  They can also serve and show care for others and in particular the last, the lost and the least in the community.  ",
			"The School promotes a positive and flourishing school culture where staff, parents and Lasallians take ownership of their own learning and well-being, to know that they can make positive choices of everything in their lives if they can practise mindfulness and gratitude. The school focuses on building a De La Salle School brand of quality work, service and relationships that ensure professionalism and uplifting Lasallians' and staff morale."
