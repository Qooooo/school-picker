It is the strong roots that would enable them to weather the storms of life; present and future. ",
			"We also aspire for the students to have wings to fly, beyond their current circumstance and mindsets about themselves. We want the students go beyond the limits and boundaries they have set in their minds for and about themselves. We believe that the school would have succeeded, if we are able to develop our students to surpass us in all that we are, and do. We believe that if we put care in our thoughts, deeds and work as a school community, the labour in every endeavour will not be in vain."
