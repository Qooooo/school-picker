		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"We are guided by the belief that 'Every Child Learns' and our efforts are directed at providing opportunities through our programmes as well as teachable moments. Children are imbued with this mindset and have self-belief and self-efficacy.",
			"We define culture as a way of life and life in school includes every day interacting and connecting with Singaporeans and children from other countries. We ensure that children appreciate each other's differences and diversity, as school is a microcosm of Society and such awareness must be built from young. To be cultured is to conduct oneself with dignity, to be humble and not be respecters of persons but respect everyone.",
			"We want our children not only to learn but learn right. Anything that is worth doing must be done well, even if it is to keep the individual desks tidy and classrooms clean. We encourage them to aspire to do their best and to try again when they face setbacks.",
			"All that we do is premised on the values of Integrity, Responsibility, Resilience and Compassion. We ensure that the values are lived out so that they are not just taught but caught. It is not enough to be honest but exhibit integrity - the moral courage to speak up or own up when something wrong has been committed; everyone must be responsible to his own work; we allow mistakes to be made so that they build resilience and when they are successful, to always remember those who are less advantaged than them and show compassion by contributing back to Society. ",
			"In NSPS we constantly build our teacher capacity through adopting a school-wide model of 'The Skillful Teacher'. We encourage our teachers to try different strategies so that they engage the children and bring about the 'joy of learning'. Teachers also frequently attend workshops and courses for fresh ideas. ",
			"All the above brings about a culture of care and every child can look forward to school, having a positive teacher-student relationship and quality school experience."
