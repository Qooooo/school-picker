Throughout its decades of history, the school believes that each HAIsian is blessed with talents and a unique identity, can become a person of integrity and compassion who contributes to a better world.  Therefore, every HAIsian is deserving of the best care and opportunities.  We help our students redefine their own boundaries of success, and to rethink what they are capable of, to dare to dream of great things.  We develop students who are persons for others and who will make society better bit by bit by having a positive impact on others' lives.  HAIsians serve the young and the elderly in the community who need comfort and support. Our teachers are exemplary in their love for students and strong belief in moulding students to be persons of character and resilience. They use effective teaching strategies and learning technologies to engage students.  Our school ethos is \"With students as our focus and excellence as our pursuit, we work with persistence and in unison, using innovative and exciting approaches to transform the whole school experience for every HAIsian.\"",
