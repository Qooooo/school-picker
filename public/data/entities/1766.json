To heighten leadership skills and global awareness, pupils embark on Internationalisation Experience where they interact with people from different cultures.",
			"Citizens of Character",
			"Our vibrant CCA programme creates opportunities for Andersonians to take their interests to the next level while building strength of character. Across varied CCAs, pupils learn important virtues such as teamwork and commitment. As they progress in skills, they also overcome challenges with diligence and resilience. Our LLPs, ALIVE and VIVACE, are testimonies to our belief in strengthening our pupils' talents through values-based CCA.",
