We see our parents as supportive partners who can play active roles in providing strong support to the school programmes in terms of time and resources. We communicate frequently with all parents to keep them informed of the school's events and programmes, teaching and learning focus and approaches. This allows the seamless transition of education from home to school and from school to home. ",
