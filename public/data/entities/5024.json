			"Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School (KCPPS) was founded by two Christian missionaries as Katong Girls' School in 1924 and developed into Choon Guan School the following year, which was subsequently renamed Presbyterian Boys' School in 1950. Today, KCPPS is one of the 5 schools supported by the Presbyterian Church in Singapore. The school is located in the Bishan area and offers places for both boys and girls. After the PERI Upgrading project in 2013 and 2014, KCPPS is currently operating as a single session school. ",
			"The school believes in delivering an education of love through developing the whole child. Not only does the school equip our pupils with skills and competencies, we also instil in them an appreciation of their spiritual and moral well-being through inculcating sound values. We help our pupils learn to take ownership for their own growth and well-being, to have the desire to care for others and the will to preserve and sustain resources in the environment for everyone and for the next generation.",
			"The school values guide and shape the culture and ethos of the school. The school values are: Amazing Love, Resilience, Integrity, Self-discipline and Excellence, forming the acronym \"ARISE\". We aspire to be a community of learners who take ownership for our own learning, collaborate to tap on each other's strengths and talents and innovate to constantly improve to excel. We hope to inspire, equip and motivate our pupils to be active contributors and concerned citizens who will step forward to make a difference to the community they are in. ",
			"The school believes in building a strong partnership with parents in caring for their child's well-being. The approach taken is proactive and early engagement. Parents are invited to participate in school events, parenting talks and workshops from the time their child is in P1 and play an active part in role modelling positive attitude and behaviour for their child at home."
