			"Through the school's vision, OEPS aims to create a positive learning environment and to provide meaningful learning experiences that nurture the child to be a caring and confident lifelong learner who strives for his/her best. The school believes that every child deserves the opportunity to learn and to grow as good role models, and to serve and to contribute back to the school and the society.",
			"Building on the strong Culture of Care and focus on Character Development, the school strives to strengthen its total curriculum through multiple structured learning platforms that allow students to practise 21st Century Competencies so that they can be self-directed and stay resilient in their pursuit for both academic and non-academic excellence. For example, the strengthening of the school's student leadership programme is intended to provide leadership experience for all students in VIA service-learning projects so that they can internalize the importance of serving and contributing to the society. ",
			"The school strongly believes that nurturing the staff competencies and building effective partnerships with stakeholders are key drivers behind the delivery of total curriculum.   The school believes that a Good OEPS Teacher exhibits competencies in three key areas namely, as Collaborative Learners, Designers of Lessons and Reflective Practitioners. These are essential qualities to build positive teacher-student relationship and meeting the present and future needs of the students. The school also acknowledges that the Opera Parents Club (OPC) is a vital link to promote home-school partnerships. By leveraging on OPC's support and expertise, the school is able to offer students richer learning experiences such as International Friendship Day and Career Day."
