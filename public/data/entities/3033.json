		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Environmental Studies and Sustainable Living aims to enhance students' awareness and understanding of environmental issues and knowledge of sustainable living. In the water sensing module, students learn about programming using Arduino and making use of sensors to measure water quality. In the clean energy module, they design prototypes that harness solar energy to power solar cars. Students are also given opportunities to understand how other country creates a sustainable environment through the ALP Overseas Trip. They are thus better equipped to understand concepts relating to environmental science, and local and global environmental issues. Students are also equipped with ICT and research skills to complete their projects and coursework. The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) provides opportunities for students to develop an appreciation for the arts and maximize their potential in their different areas of talents. Through the learning and training processes in the arts, students develop good character and 21st century competencies. These learning experiences in Arts Education not only deepen students' awareness and interest in the various aesthetics areas, but also teach them ways to transfer their learning to serve the community. In line with the school's vision of preparing students to be leaders for the future, the school develops in students self-awareness for personal leadership and effectiveness. Workshops and Leadership camps are organised for student leaders (class leaders, CCA leaders and Student Councillors) to enable them to lead with competence and confidence. The school provides opportunities for students to participate in sports; and mounts life-skills programmes (such as the Biennial Fiesta and Musical, Motivational and Study Skills Workshops, subject-based learning journeys, VIA, overseas cultural exchanges and Cohort Overseas Trip) for the holistic development of students."
