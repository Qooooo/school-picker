Students discover themselves and develop a better appreciation of one another's uniqueness using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator assessment. They will learn effective strategies to leverage their strengths and build competencies in other areas, and collaborate with others. The GESS LIFE programme will provide school-wide, cohort and personal opportunities for every student to purposefully apply their knowledge and skills to impact their school and community. The GESS Applied Learning Programme and GESS Probes* serve to prepare students for their future workplace. It aims to develop future workskills such as transdisciplinarity, design thinking, and novel and adaptive thinking in students. The programme focuses on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Aesthetics and Mathematics) as well as the design thinking process. Probes* refers to the underwater probe that students will be tasked to design. They will also learn basic coding as part of their learning process. There are two tiers for the programme catering to different needs of the students."
