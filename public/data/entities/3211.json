		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": "Jurong Secondary School (JSS) was founded in 1963 at the request of community leaders to our Founding Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, when he made his first visit to the Jurong Constituency. Originally named Jurong Integrated Secondary School, the school offered both the English and Chinese streams. That JSS became widely known for its rich Chinese heritage and strong community partnerships stemmed from this unique history. Since its founding, JSS honours its commitment to the community by offering an all-round education for our students. Innovative programmes guided by our school values of Loyalty, Industry, Sincerity, and Love were introduced to nurture our students' character and cultivate thinking and independent learning, enabling them to pursue excellence in all that they do and grow as concerned citizens with a heart for and who contribute meaningfully back to the community. As a pioneer of the FutureSchool@Singapore project, our school leverages ICT to design a student-centric learning experience that emphasises acquisition of 21st century competencies.",
