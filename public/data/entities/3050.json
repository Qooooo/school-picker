		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "In Xinmin, we are committed to preparing our students well for further learning and the future world of work by developing them into leaders of hearts and leaders of minds. We develop 21st Century Competencies (21CCC) in our students through our thoughtfully designed curriculum and a tiered approach to provide students with a range of learning experiences that would cater to their different interests and readiness levels. Some of our key school-based curriculum include (i) Coding@Xinmin, in which we develop computational thinking in our students through coding; (ii) our lower secondary Drama programme, through which we build our students' self-confidence, ability to empathise and understanding of the human condition; (iii) a challenging and enjoyable PE programme that helps our students develop both the skills and dispositions that allow them to lead a healthy active lifestyle; and (iv) our Student Leadership Development Programme that provides authentic learning opportunities to groom our students as leaders who will go on to make a difference to the school and their community. These key programmes are embedded within an enriching learning environment that incorporates a games-based approach to develop core 21CC like critical and inventive thinking; harnesses the affordance of technology to enhance students' learning, develop them as responsible online citizens, and as collaborative and self-directed learners (e.g., through our signature Flipped Classroom Pedagogy); and emphasises application of knowledge in real life."
