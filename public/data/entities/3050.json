This is done through a range of activities and programmes. Our students excel in sports and outdoor activities, arts, service to school and community, as well as in their academic studies. The school community is strongly supported by a committed and dedicated team of alumni and the School Advisory Committee, who believe in providing a holistic and enriching school experience for our students. Facilities in the school are constantly upgraded and leading programmes are developed to stretch the cognitive, physical, aesthetics, and social-moral domains of development of our students. Student learning is also enabled through a capable team of teachers who demonstrate the highest level of professionalism and care as they design and carry out activities and programmes, both in and out of the classrooms.
