			"In Junyuan Primary School (JYPS), we believe that every child is special, valuable and important. We seek to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, values and skills that will prepare them adequately to face the challenges of the future. ",
			"The school has identified five distinct strands of outcomes known as the Desired Junyuan Outcomes (DJOs) that each student should achieve through three defined key stages by the end of P6. They are Self-Directed Learners, Adaptable Individuals, Critical Thinkers, Confident Communicators and Concerned Citizens. ",
			"These outcomes were identified based on the school's philosophy of preparing our students for the future and to mould them as leaders of character. ",
			"The school seeks to develop students who are grounded in values and are concerned citizens who can contribute positively to the school, home and community. The acronym EnR3ICH outlines the 7 JYPS school values: ExcelleNce, Respect, Responsibility, Resilience, Integrity, Care, Harmony.",
			"The 7 values are introduced during our assembly programmes, Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Lessons and reinforced through our school-based programmes. They provide a guide for our students to be able to distinguish right from wrong, help them make responsible choices, foster positive relationships with their peers and others, be able to display leadership qualities in the areas of leading self and leading others, as well as help them become more aware of their roles in school, the community and Singapore. ",
			"The school motto 'Work to Excel' embodies the spirit in JYPS where our students are self-directed in learning and seek opportunities for progress and innovation. They will be confident in their communication and develop a critical mind for thinking. He/She will be adaptable to take on new roles readily and demonstrate resilience in the face of challenges."
