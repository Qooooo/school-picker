		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Student Development (SD) Programme offers specially designed modules: Digital & info-com technology, Relation & business, Engineering, science & maths, Arts & humanities, Media & design, and Sports & leisure (DREAMS) enables our students to discover their interest & passion, learn new skills,  build their portfolios and work towards their aspirations. The SD Programme comprises mandatory and choice modules.  Within the SD programme, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - 'Exploring Possibilities with Materials Science', Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - INSPIRE@BLS and Project Work (ASEF/I&E) are mandatory modules for all lower secondary students. ALP equips students with design thinking skills to explore with materials to solve everyday problems.  Eventually, students use chromebooks to access online tools to create 3D-printable products and use 3D printer and laser cutter to produce prototypes of their designs. With a focus on Music and the Performing Arts, INSPIRE@BLS (Igniting Students' Passion and Interests through Arts-related Experiences), contributes to the holistic development of our students by inculcating values, socio-emotional competencies, life skills  and a passion for lifelong learning and appreciation for the arts. The Asia Europe Foundation (ASEF) programme offers online project opportunities for our students to work in collaboration with Asian and European partner schools from countries such as Italy, India and Netherlands. This programme allows them to push their learning frontiers for active citizenry, self-discovery and the development of multi-cultural literacy.  The Innovation & Enterprise (I&E) programme focuses on developing students in innovative thinking and the understanding of the business process towards creating a social enterprise."
