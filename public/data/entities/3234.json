		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Shuqun Secondary School (SQSS) envisions Shuqunites as individuals rooted in character and equipped with relevant skills to contribute to our nation. Underlying all academic and co-curriculum is the Whole School Curriculum with its 5 guiding principles - building Character and Motivation, seeing students as Partners in Learning, Personalising Instruction, providing Real Experiences and Enabling Learning beyond the classroom and school.  The Shuqun Personalised Asynchronous cuRriculum for Collaboration and Self-directed learning (SPARCS) is one of the signature programmes which explores a disruptive model of teaching and learning through the use of technology in the classroom. Through SPARCS, the school aims to improve the quality of teaching & learning experiences and nurture competencies such as Self-Directed and Collaborative Learning among the students. The school's \"Tutorial Relationships\" pedagogy is an approach used in the N(T) Mathematics curriculum that encourages problem solving, peer tutoring and metacognitive reflection in students.  Aligned to the school's dynamic curriculum that supports its vision, mission and strategic directions, the school's STEM Applied Learning Programme, the Coding, Design Thinking & Robotics (CODER) programme,  seeks to cultivate an innovative and design thinking mindset in students where they are able to represent tasks and develop work processes through logics and coding to solve real world problems. The school's new integrated CCE and PE programme, Sports and Outdoor Experiences foR Values Education (SERVE), under its Lifelong Learning Programme (LLP) supports the school's broader mission of providing a well-rounded and holistic education for the students.  SERVE nurtures character through sports and outdoor experiences and builds positive traits such as teamwork, perseverance and sportsmanship aligned to the school values."
