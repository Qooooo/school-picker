		"School Mission": "Enabling youth in a Lasallian community to learn how to learn and to learn how to live; empowering them to become men of integrity and men for others.",
		"School Philosophy, Culture and Ethos": [
			"Our vision is to bring out the BEST in the boys - Belief in self; Excellence in all; Service to others; True to one's faith.",
			"\"Belief in Self\" expresses our spirit of faith, and our desire for all boys to know that God made each one of us a good person with our unique sets of gifts, talents and abilities which should be developed and used in the service of others. This belief also reminds us to put our faith in our teachers and learn to trust our friends.",
			"\"Excellence in All\" embodies the spirit of zeal that we want our boys to give their best in everything that they do. This means putting in effort in school work and CCA, as well as in leading, serving and getting along with others. The motto, Ora et Labora, which is to pray and work, reminds us to strive for excellence by turning our hearts to God and working hard.",
			"\"Service to Others\" reminds us that we want our Junior Josephians to be other-centred by being a servant leader, and to be a man who lives his life for others. We want our boys to understand this paradox of life that we have to give in order to receive. We want our boys to take ownership of the school by contributing towards making the school a happier, cleaner, safer and more disciplined place. We want our boys to help other boys to be at their best, and in so doing, reach their best themselves.",
			"\"True to One's Faith\" asks our boys to be aware of and cultivate their spiritual side and to become men of Integrity. To do the right things even when no one is watching. We want our boys to be faithful to their own religions, and become a better Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist etc. We want all our boys to do all their actions for the love of God.",
			"To achieve this vision laid out for the school, the school focusses on 5 key areas: Teaching and Learning, Character Formation, Nurturing Talents Holistically, Staff Development and Organisational Excellence."
