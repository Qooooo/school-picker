The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) `Totally Wholesome Engaged and Empowered Teens' (TWEETS) is another signature programme offered to all students.

It also provides them with a platform  to practise and live out the school values and to  network and collaborate with external organizations. Through its LLP, the school seeks to make community and youth leadership more pervasive and to foster a culture of volunteerism. The school is also on board the `Whole School Approach to Effective Communication' (WSA-EC), to provide a conducive environment for the  learning of the English Language."
