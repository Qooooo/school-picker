		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school has adopted the Building Learning Power approach in integrating character education and academic learning. Through the direct instruction of relevant learning dispositions, students are introduced to good habits and values as a foundation for more effective learning. This will also prepare students to better handle challenges outside the classroom in a calm and confident way.  Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - \"Smart Home and Assistive Technologies\" aims for students to learn the science behind SMART Technologies, and understand its application in the modern home.  Students may get to work on innovative ways for how the safety and security of the elderly or handicapped can be enhanced.  This exemplifies the values-driven aspect of our curriculum to enable students to play a part in contributing towards building a more vibrant and caring society. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - \"Learning through the Arts\" aims to develop students' appreciation for various art forms.  Students will have opportunities to experience the arts both as audience and participants; and develop an interest in various forms of cultural expression.  The school has an on-going Taipei Exchange Programme to foster global awareness and cross-cultural skills of students. There is also a whole school approach in the championing of Reading Literacy for personal growth and excellence. With these programmes in place, our students are developed holistically as passionate learners and compassionate leaders."
