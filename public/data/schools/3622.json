We aim to foster a vibrant learning community with a nurturing school climate through diverse and engaging school programmes with ample opportunities for all. Our culture and ethos are 'Achieve our Best' (every student a 'North Star'); 'Believe in Every Child' (everyone can achieve and all can succeed); 'Care for Every Child' (every teacher guides and mentors each 'North Star' in developing holistically as individuals) and 'Determined to Learn' (every student comes to school with the right attitude for learning and the mindset of high expectations).  Our North Star Education Programme offers a total curriculum to develop our students to be world and future-ready, with the right values and 21st century competencies. Our instructional programme is based on i-TEACH Framework for integrated, engaged and assessed learning, with teachers as curriculum innovators, collaborative learners and holistic educators.
