		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "With our school's Student Development Vision of \"Every Temasekian, A Caring Leader\", all students undergo a journey of growth in personal mastery and leadership through a structured 4-year leadership course. This course empowers them with the attitude and aptitude to succeed in their academic pursuits and character development. Students who demonstrate potential and interest, are further developed to lead in various school-level and community-based activities as CCA leaders and/or leaders in one of the five student leadership groups. These experiences allow them to apply their leadership skills as well as develop empathy for others. Students with strong academic and leadership inclinations can also participate in the Temasek IGNIS programme-a talent development programme for students to deepen inquiry, problem-solving and communication skills. To navigate and thrive in a culturally-diverse 21st century workplace and world, all Temasekians are developed in Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A) through a specially designed and integrated school-based curriculum. Students are introduced to C2A in Secondary 1 via Project Culture which piques their curiosity to learn about various components of culture. Through the Secondary 2 Camp Culture as well as a range of other academic and co-curriculum platforms, students progressively learn to observe, appreciate and interpret different cultural practices and behaviours. The learning culminates in experiential opportunities such as overseas learning trips, collaborations with local international schools and work attachments where students apply their knowledge and skills to work with people from other cultures."
