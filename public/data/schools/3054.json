		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "The school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP), the Holistic ARTs (HART) Programme, provides all lower secondary students with a variety of learning experiences beyond the formal Art curriculum. A rich repertoire comprising six arts modules (ceramics, sculpture, digital art, music composition, instrument playing and dance) deepens appreciation and enhances knowledge and skills in the Arts. Students who demonstrate talent are provided platforms and opportunities to further hone their talents through the Visual Arts Talent Development Programme. The school was presented with the National Arts Education Glow Award (2013) by the National Arts Council in recognition of its holistic approach to Arts Education. The school's Applied Learning Programme (ALP), the iCAST Programme, allows students to apply English Language skills from various genres in an authentic setting. All lower secondary students go through the Media Studies Programme where they further hone their language skills as they engage in scripting, video-casting and storyboarding. Students also acquire related ICT skills progressively.  The iCast Programme not only facilitates the use of the English Language to communicate ideas and values and to educate the community, but also allows students to deepen their learning. Students are also offered a glimpse of the possible careers in the fields of media and broadcasting."
