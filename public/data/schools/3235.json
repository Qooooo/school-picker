Through cultural workshops, drama-in-curriculum classes, theatre experience, masterclasses, accreditation examinations and public performances, students cultivate sound values, social-emotional competencies, and pursue their passion and talent in the aesthetics. Level Camps (ONEIRIC, SPARK, METAMORPHOSIS, QUEST, CONQUEST) is another dedicated CCE programme that develops character and social emotional competencies in our students through powerful, experiential learning experience. Students can expect enriched learning in our ALP and LLP, curricular and co-curricular programmes, such as Education and Career Guidance Programme and twinning programmes through our partnerships with Institutes of Higher Learning, community and government agency partners and overseas schools."
