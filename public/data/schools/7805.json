			"The School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST) is a Specialised Independent School that offers a distinctive 4-year GCE O-Level programme with an integrated approach to applied learning. Learning in SST is multi-faceted as students gain a strong foundation of key academic concepts in Science, Technology, Art, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The school-wide leverage on Information Communication Technology (ICT) greatly enhances the learning environment and provides the extended learning resources and networks that the digital natives have come to expect. As a FutureSchool, SST aims to be a forerunner in using ICT to support educational programmes and enhance the delivery of its specialised curriculum.",
			"SST caters to students who learn best in an active applied learning environment, where conceptual understandings and transference of disciplinary content knowledge and skills are fostered through cognitively demanding hands-on applications set in real world situations. Sound affective, character and leadership education, national education, and entrepreneurial programmes serve to equip students with the skills and competencies crucial for success in the 21st century and nurture the values-driven and community-responsible person and leader.",
