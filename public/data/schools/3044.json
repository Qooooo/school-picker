		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "As our foundational programme, we adopted Arthur L. Costa's the Habits of Mind (HOM) since 2003 to inculcate in BBSSians good learning habits and thinking dispositions that every student should practice daily to be equipped for future challenges as self-directed, life-long learners. Using the pedagogy of Activity-Based Learning, students go through the learning cycle of Taught, Caught and Practice to hone these dispositions. For example, Sec 1s hone the disposition of \"Gathering Data through All Senses\" by going around the school using their 5 senses to increase their power of observation as part of a HOM lesson. Our Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is the Community Youth Leadership (CYL) Programme which aims to nurture RESPECTful Leaders who are confident and self-directed in serving the community with abundance mentality. This programme encompasses the twin pillars of Leadership Development and Values In Action (VIA) to provide BBSSians with leadership training experiences and opportunities to organise community-wide events like Project Mi and Blood Donation Drive, and participate in overseas service learning expeditions like Project Heartwork. Such projects aims to develop dispositions like \"Listening with Understanding and Empathy\" and \"Questioning and Problem Posing\". Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) is in the area of embedded electronics which builds upon the fundamentals of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) to develop BBSSians as proactive problem-solvers who care for the world. Focusing on application of sensing technologies in our everyday life, lower sec students learn to solve self-identified real life problems and interested upper sec students go on to collaborate with school partners to design solutions, participate in competitions, job shadowing and attend STEM related elective modules. By cultivating the disposition of \"Remaining open to Continuous Learning\", we endeavour to prepare the students well for the future."
