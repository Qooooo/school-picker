			"Montfort Secondary, established in 1916, is a Government Aided School of the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel under the Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore.  As a Catholic school, we espouse the Universal Gospel Values and are committed to providing an inclusive, safe and dynamic environment for all our boys regardless of faith and background.  We also believe that there is a place for an all-boys education and we develop and cater our programmes to the needs of boys - giving them appropriate structure and discipline as well as the space to grow and discover their leadership, talents and strengths.",
			"Our School Motto \"Age Quod Agis\" translates to \"Do Well in Whatever you Do\".  It reminds our boys of the dignity of work and that the work they do is important and represents who they are.  Therefore, they need to take pride in their assigned tasks and do them to the best of their abilities.  Our School Values are Compassion, Humility, Respect, Integrity, Service, Team Spirit & Excellence - together they spell CHRISTE which also represents our faith in God and Christ."

		"Special Student Development Programmes Offered": "Underlying Montfort Secondary's teaching and learning approach is the belief that boys learn better when we adopt Boy-Centric Teaching (BCT) strategies. Translated into classroom delivery, this would mean that teachers now incorporate novelty, movement and relevance into their lessons. The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in Information Systems Technology & Design that was recently introduced aims to provide our students with foundational skills in this frontier learning domain. The development of leadership and character is another vital part of our Montfortian Education.  We do this through our flagship Montfort Values Plus (MVP) programme that is aligned to MOE's CCE curriculum and supported by a tiered Values-in-Action Programme for our boys from Secondary 1 through 5. Montfort's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is centred on Leadership Development through Sports (Badminton, Softball & Football) & Outdoor Education, where our boys hone their leadership skills through various class, CCA and school activities, embarking on community and school projects based on the Kouzes & Posner Leadership Challenge Model. For our Catholic Boys, we have programmes catered for them including Religious & Moral Education lessons, regular Eucharistic celebrations.  The school also provides opportunities for the students to appreciate the Arts through our 3 \"E\" Approach (Exposure, Expression & Excellence). All Secondary 1 students can look forward to participating in arts, music and theatre workshops organised by the Performing Arts CCAs."
