Our teachers are caring and dedicated in their efforts to nurture the whole child through strong teacher-student rapport. Through a range of instructional and co-curricula programmes, we shape our students' character and build a culture of affirmation, collaboration and excellence. We believe that our students should contribute to the society in line with our core values of IExCEL (Integrity, Excellence, Compassion, Enterprise and Loyalty). The vibrancy of the school culture develops our students' life skills and empowers them to make a positive difference to others. The school's Values-In-Action programme focuses on four key areas - Care for the Elderly, Love for the Environment, Help the Needy and Community Bonding. Over the years, we have forged a close partnership with Taman Jurong CC to serve the community in our neighbourbood. Through service to others, we are confident that every student will grow to be individuals who epitomise our vision;  'A Thinker, an Achiever and a Concerned Citizen'.",

Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students can also do so if they do well in those subjects. Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Dragon Boat gRowing Values instils the school values in students and enables their acquisition of skills in dragon boating, swimming and life-saving. Applied Learning Programme: Maritime Architecture & Engineering enthuses learners by connecting their knowledge and skills learnt in classrooms to maritime-related context. Students will acquire Scientific Process and Design Thinking skills and apply these skills in the Marine Robotic (SeaPerch) programme. They will also develop relevant values and life skills through collaborating to design and build marine vehicles. Student Leadership Development: The Leadership Challenge Model enhances students' inter-personal and communication skills, develops leadership competencies and builds teamwork. Overseas cultural exchange and outdoor learning programmes expose students to authentic learning experiences that nurture character and values. Environmental education deepens understanding and develops active citizenry in students who will care for the environment. Aesthetics programmes use a  multi-faceted approach to develop in students an appreciation for the aesthetics and to discover their interests and strengths. Student-led programmes reinforce values and promote critical thinking and decision-making."
