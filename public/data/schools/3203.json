This has been the result of teachers exploring new pedagogy in Professional Learning Teams and stretching student capacity through curricular enrichment activities. Examples include engaging Science project work tasks at the lower secondary level and the use of manipulatives in Mathematics teaching. Our students participate annually in competitions for Mathematics & Science, including the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad, workshops at Singapore Science Centre and Advanced Elective Modules (with a science focus) at local polytechnics.  The school also champions reading literacy. In collaboration with the National Library Board, we have embarked on a whole-school effort to promote reading as a habit among students. We emerged first runner-up in the NLB 2017 Reading Excellence Award."
